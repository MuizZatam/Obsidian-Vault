Debian is a complete GNU/Linux operating system, including software and systems for installation and management, all based on the Linux kernel and free software (especially those from the GNU project).

The GNU project is a range of free software developed, or sponsored, by the Free Software Foundation FSF, originated by its iconic leader, Dr. Richard M. Stallman. GNU is a recursive acronym, standing for “GNU is Not Unix”.

Debian is not an acronym. This name is, in reality, a contraction of two first names: that of Ian Murdock, and his girlfriend at the time, Debra. Debra + Ian = Debian.

Ian Murdock died on 28 December 2015 in San Francisco after a series of worrying tweets where he reported having been assaulted by police. In July 2016 it was announced that his death had been ruled a suicide.
